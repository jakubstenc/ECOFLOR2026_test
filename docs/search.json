    "text": "Welcome to the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Spanish Group for Floral Ecology and Evolution (ECOFLOR)!\n\nWe‚Äôre pleased to announce the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Floral Ecology and Evolution working group, EcoFlor, which will take place from February 11-14, 2026, in Tortosa.\nEcoFlor is a working group of the Spanish Association of Terrestrial Ecology (AEET). It organizes an annual congress to discuss recent scientific findings. The 2026 meeting will be held at the Centre C√≠vic Ferreries, located in the city center of the medieval city of Tortosa, on the banks of the Ebro River.\nThe EcoFlor annual meeting brings together scientists interested in floral ecology and evolution. Its goal is to promote discussion, networking, and creativity in science, involving students at all career stages in an open and friendly environment. Participants are invited to present their ongoing projects and engage in critical scientific discussion and networking. In recent years, EcoFlor has expanded its reach, achieving an international dimension and welcoming contributions from researchers worldwide.\nFollowing the traditional format, the meeting will feature two days of presentations (Thursday and Friday), including plenary talks, as well as oral and poster contributions. These will be thematically structured based on the submitted abstracts.\nIn addition, there will be workshops on Wednesday and a field trip on Saturday to the Ports Natural Parks (a mountain range affected by a recent wildfire) and the Delta (an area of aquatic ecosystems and ecosystem restoration). The congress dinner will be held on Thursday evening.\nAll contributions should be in English to promote discussion and interaction with our international audience.\n\n\nüìÖ 9-10th February 2026\nüìç Tortosa\n‚úâÔ∏è Submit your abstract and register until November 30th, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit your oral or poster contribution in the form.\nRegistration form here\n\n\n\n\nAttendance at the meeting is free, but registration is mandatory for logistical reasons. Please fill out the form if you plan to attend.\nWhen registering, you can also submit a proposal for an oral or poster presentation. Awards will be given for the best oral and best poster presentations.\nSenior researchers are also welcome to propose opening talks. These talks will be slightly longer than oral presentations and will consist of short lectures on research lines, breakthrough ideas, or emerging topics of scientific interest, rather than the results of specific studies.\nWe also welcome proposals for workshops to be held on Wednesday the 11th (the day of arrival). We especially encourage workshops that help early-career researchers develop skills, such as fieldwork methods, sample processing, laboratory protocols, data analysis, and scientific writing. Discussions on emerging topics of interest and networking opportunities are also welcome!\nAt the end of the form, there is a questionnaire to find out if you‚Äôd be interested in participating in the parallel activities. Once we know the potential attendance, we‚Äôll provide more information to participants.\n\n\n\nThe meeting is limited to 100 participants. Acceptance will be based on a combination of factors: the order of registration, whether you submit a contribution, and the scientific scope of your work. We highly encourage young researchers to submit their contributions, as the scientific commission will give them priority for acceptance.\n\n\n\nPlease submit your abstract in English during the registration process. The abstract should not exceed 200 words. When submitting, please also provide five keywords that will help us organize the conference sessions.\nEach main author may submit only one contribution. We kindly request that the main author be the one who submits the abstract.\n\n\n\nOral presentations will be 12 minutes long, and all slides must be in English.\nIf your presentation is accepted, please email your slides to ecoflor2026@gmail.com by February 2nd. The organizing committee will use your file solely for projection during the conference and will delete it immediately afterward.\nPoster Presentations\nPosters will be displayed in a room next to the main hall throughout the conference.\nPoster sessions will take place during the coffee breaks: a 30-minute session in the morning and a one-hour session in the afternoon. The afternoon break, which will include coffee and beer, is specifically designed to encourage discussion and networking with poster presenters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarie Sk≈Çodowska Curie PhD\nSome text, some text, some text, some text, some text, some text, some text.
