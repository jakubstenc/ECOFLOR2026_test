For this reason, a meeting is held annually in the form of a congress in which different groups present the results of their ongoing research to promote collaboration, the development of common methodologies and the discussion of results. In recent years, EcoFlor has extended its frontiers and has reached an international dimension, receiving contributions from researchers from all over the world.\nFollowing our tradition, the meeting will consist of two days of presentations, with plenary talks and oral and poster contributions that will be structured thematically according to the abstracts we receive. In addition, several parallel activities are planned: XX.\nGiven that we expect that many of the attendees may be non-spanish speakers, contributions should be in English in order to promote discussion and interaction.\nüìÖ The meeting will take place on 9-10th February 2026.\nüìçTortosa"
